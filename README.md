### What I learned

Building a landing page with Bootstrap components allowed me to learn how to make a webpage responsive using the "srcset" attribute for images that adapts to different screen resolutions. Additionally, I gained experience with overlapping elements and positioning properties in CSS to create dynamic layouts. Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience that improved my web development skills and gave me a better understanding of techniques used for creating visually appealing and responsive designs.


### Continued development

As I progress in my web development skills, I am keen to enhance my proficiency in implementing responsive images. I aim to explore different techniques for optimizing image performance on a diverse range of devices and screen sizes, such as using attributes like "srcset" and "sizes" to deliver the appropriate image resolution for each device. Additionally, I wish to explore lazy-loading techniques for images, which can reduce page loading times and bandwidth usage. By broadening my knowledge of responsive images, I hope to create visually appealing websites that offer a seamless and efficient user experience across all devices.
